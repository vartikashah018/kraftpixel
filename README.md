KraftPixel Internship Assignment – About Us Section

This repository contains my submission for the front-end internship task assigned by KraftPixel.

Task Summary
The objective was to recreate specific sections of the "About Us" page using the provided Figma design. The reference image (https://i.imgur.com/EU9IjCB.png) shows the specific sections to be built. I followed a mobile-first responsive design approach. The coding time was strictly limited to 1 hour, with an additional 15–20 minutes for hosting, GitHub push, and video recording.

Key Features

Mobile-first responsive design

Custom HTML and CSS written from scratch (no frameworks like Bootstrap or templates)

Clean, semantic HTML structure

BEM-inspired class naming and organized CSS

Fully responsive using media queries with breakpoints for desktop screens (min-width: 768px)

Technologies Used
HTML5 and CSS3 were used along with a code editor (VS Code). Git and GitHub were used for version control and code hosting. I used Chrome DevTools for responsive testing.

Folder Structure
The project includes index.html and styles.css as main files. There is an assets/images folder for image content, a README.md file for documentation, and optionally an AI-Declaration.txt file (if applicable).

Live Demo and Repository
Live Site: (https://kraftpixel-git-main-vartikashah018s-projects.vercel.app)
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/vartikashah018/kraftpixel
Responsive Design Notes
The site is designed for mobile-first use. At wider viewports (768px and above), a media query adjusts the layout to be desktop-friendly.

Time Log
I began coding at 3:00 pm and stopped exactly after 1 hour. I spent 15 more minutes for GitHub and deployment.
